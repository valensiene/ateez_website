        <p>ATEEZ, initially known as KQ Fellaz, began their journey as a pre-debut group,
            showcasing their talents through various performances and online content.
            They gained attention and a growing fan base even before their official debut.
            ATEEZ officially debuted on October 24, 2018, with their first mini album titled
            "Treasure EP.1: All to Zero." Their double title tracks "Pirate King," and
            "Treasure" introduced their unique concept, blending powerful performances,
            captivating visuals, and a distinctive sound.

  <p>ATEEZ debuted in 2018 with the explosive singles “Pirate King” and “Treasure,”
    and as their career and popularity have evolved, so has their interpretation of 
    the original pirate theme. No one is happier about the pivot back to piracy than 
    the bearer of said eye patch, ATEEZ’s magnetic leader Hongjoong—their “captain,” 
    as the group calls him. His crew consists of striking, graceful Seonghwa; affable 
    dancer Yunho; intense, animated San; slinky, scene-stealing Wooyoung; warm, soft-spoken 
    baritone Yeosang; growly, sweetly shy rapper Mingi; and prodigious power-belter Jongho.

  <p>ATINY is ATEEZ's official fandom name. The name was announced by ATEEZ on V Live
    on November 17, 2018. The acronym ATINY stands for "ATEEZ and destiny", and it denotes
    that ATEEZ's future is inextricably linked to their fans.

    The name of this emblematic object is LIGHTINY, a combination of the word 'Light' and 'Destiny'.
    Since 'ATINY' is what brings 'ATEEZ' and 'Destiny' together, LIGHTINY as the "destiny of light"
    would also symbolize the tight bond among their fans.
